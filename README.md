We place our research in the setting of Chinese stock market. We find that the instructing role of market fundamentals on stock exchange is weakened when investors are engaged in the collective action known as chasing the market, i.e. the entering or exiting stock market with the intention of profiting from an occurring trend of price movement. Indeed, it is frequently observed in Chinese stock market that stock prices keep rising unboundedly when fundamentals are not looking that promising, and a slump always ensues. The setting can be simplified to a game of collective action, in which the price slump is the realized equilibrium when investors collectively choose to exit the market. Theoretically, a slump is probable at any time during the market-chasing game for investors will eventually withdraw out of impatience. However in practice, we notice the fact that slumps occur with substantially higher frequency when market index are close to numbers with salient feature. Such phenomenon we will be referred to as round-number effect throughout this proposal.
